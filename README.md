# Tasks and project for my Emerging Technologies module
Below will be all the explanations on my tasks in this module.

## Installation pre-requisites.
* Python 3.x installed on your system
  * Can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Required Python packages (install via pip):
  * `pip install numpy`
  * `pip install jupyter` (for running notebooks)
  * json module (built into Python)
* Web browser for running the Eliza chat bot
  * Any modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
* Git for version control
  * Can be downloaded from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Text editor or IDE of your choice
  * Recommended: VS Code with Python extension

You should also be able to run this in default codespaces or download as .zip to avoid downloading Git.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook trigrams.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the tasks.
5. To use the Eliza chat bot, open the `index.html` file in a web browser or open the GitHub pages link at the bottom of this file.

## Task 1: Third-order letter approximation model
* Defined a method to clean the text. 
* It opens the text file, finds the start and end words and slices that chunk out and only keeps that part.
* It converts everything to uppercase and only keeps the letters A-Z.
* Now I get five different books and run it through that method and add them all to one string.
* Goes through the entire text and finds every trigram and puts it in to a dictionary.

## Task 2: Third-order letter approximation generation
* Start with "TH".
* Loop through the dictionary of trigrams. 
* Find the trigrams that includes the last two characters to get the weights.
* Use the weights to predict what to add next.

## Task 3: Analysing my model
* Read in a list of real English words from a file.
* Defined a method to calculate the percentage of real words in the generated text.
* Split the generated text into individual words and check each word against the list of real words.
* Calculate and return the percentage of words that are real.

## Task 4: Exporting my model as JSON
* Export the trigram model dictionary as a JSON file.
* Use the `json` module to write the dictionary to a file named `trigrams.json`.
* Print a confirmation message once the export is complete.

## Project: Eliza chat bot
* Is being hosted here: [https://ryano2022.github.io/ATU-Year-4-Emerging-Technologies/](https://ryano2022.github.io/ATU-Year-4-Emerging-Technologies/)
* Has a chat history box, a chat input box and a send button. Should be pretty self explanatory on how to use.
* Sends your response to a regex pattern and selects a random response from that. (Responses were generated by GitHub Copilot).
